# Python Scientific Programs

## Introduction

I am doing my free courses offered by FreeCodeCamp Organization.

## Projects

### Program on Caesar-Cipher Encryption with Python

### Python Projects for Solving Basic Scientific Problems

Python is a powerful and popular programming language widely used for data science, data visualization, web development, game development, machine learning, and more.

In this project, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in Python, such as variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements. You'll use these to code your first programs.

### Project Details

1. **String Manipulation by Building a Cipher**
   - Building a Caesar-Cipher
   - Building a Vigenere Cipher

2. **Learn and Work with Numbers and Strings using Luhn's Algorithm**

3. **List Comprehensions in Python**
   - Building a program that can take a camelCase or PascalCase formatted string and convert it to a snake_case formatted string.

4. **Case Conversion Program**
   - Using list comprehension and string manipulation methods.

5. **Password Generator**
   - Using Regular Expressions.

6. **Shortest-Path Algorithm**
   - Designing using Dictionaries.
